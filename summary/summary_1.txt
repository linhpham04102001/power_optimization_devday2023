Google: iGrid monitors the reliability of electric distribution.

1. iGrid sells solar panel to household and then household sells (buys) electric to grid power. Right?

2. Power gen process is from company itself or gathered from household?

3. What does exactly battery do? 
 idea: Use for storing for some several use without need for power generation. Is it compulsory?
 
4. The issue of the price of electricity:
 The source of generation may have varying cost.

Luan: The process of electric gen from plant is hard to store -> Need 2 forecast.

5. Percent in cloud: 100 % mean no electricty and 0% mean full sunny. Right?
   What do exec date and target date mean?

6. All data are recorded in same time zone?
	
7. The letter T in target_date means what? 

8. THe exec date and target data has same or different time zone? What does it mean?

9. Does the cloud are forecasted or measured?

10. The weather data is not in order. -> Need ordering.

11. What does consumption and regenerative power energy mean in file realne surplus 20220101_20221231.xlsx?
 The second and third field: Regenerative and Power consumption meaning? (Column B & C).
The timestamp is used in the GMT 0 and GMT + 9?

 The energy predicted is the sum of the two columns B & C or each columns?
	Take screenshot of it. 
What does 30101 meaning in this file

12. In realne_report_solar_30_v00001_20220301_20230228.
 The field are 30001, 30011, 30021, 30031. Assume: It is the ID of 4 panels. The task is to forecast of power gen  of each panel and the total.
 The energy of solar panel generated is for each cell or the sum of all cells? 
 The timestamp is used in the GMT 0 and GMT + 9?


 Regenerative: In daytime, there's no consumption from grid, use solar when able to.

13. There is some time when solar energy is gen but just use from grid. (1/3/2022). Why?
Assume: Use one model for each factory.

Idea: Each plant has solar panel built. If the generation and demand is able to forecast, we can know the amount of grids we need.

Idea: Each 48 target date corresponds to a single execution date.

Idea: The plant is for consumption. The plant has a panel to have alternate source of electric.

14. EDA for battery: Sum of electricity in each row.
 (?) The value is the amount of electric stored or used? (or the number of energy stored in battery in the timestamp).
 (?) The value is cummulative?
 (?) Energy of 1 day is the sum of all rows of all columns?

15. In solar_v00001, the P is the average within 30 and P at that exact timestamp?

16. In weather_forecast_v00001, telop_code and telop_name meaning? 
	Assume: The ID of the weather pattern.

Task: Predict energy gen from the panel of each location.
	Predict electric demand of each location.
